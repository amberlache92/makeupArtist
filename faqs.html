   <dt>   Im not having a wedding can I still use your services for my event?</dt>
    <dd>Of course! I do makeup for any occasion. If you want your makeup done for an event or other special occaison please contact me at least 3 days in advance .However time is of the essence since appointments are hard to find last minute.</dd>

  <dt>How far In advance should I book for my wedding?</dt>
   <dd>Typically people book as far as a year in advance for their wedding. The sooner you schedule the better it is for you. Bridal appointments should be booked no late than 6 months before your big day.</dd>


  <dt> Is there a travel fee?</dt>
   <dd> I travel up to 25 miles within the 45202 zipcode with no charge. Additional charge varies depending on the distance.I do all appointments on location </dd>

   <dt> Can You also do hair for my wedding?</dt>
    <dd>Unfortunately that is not in my list of strong skills. However I am able to direct you to hairstylists that you can enlist for your special day. Hair should done before the makeup application process because you do not want to mess up your makeup when you change.</dd>

   <dt> How do I prepare for my makeup application?</dt>
    <dd>Make sure that you exfoilate and wash your face up  2 hours before  and make sure you have a good skin care routine the weeks prior to the appointment date. No products should be added prior to the makep application  for the best possible results. Wearing clothes that either button or zip up would be most appropriate to not mess up the makeup.</dd>


    <dt>How do I book an appointment?</dt>
      <dd>To book an appointment you can call, email, or fill out the form on the contact page.I typically respond within 24 hours to discuss what your looking for. All appointments require a deposit.</dd>

   <dt>If something comes up can I reschedule or cancel my appointment?</dt>
    <dd>If you must reshedule  I suggest doing so in a timely manner in order to get the date that you want.I would also sugguest being very sure of the date the first time around. Cancellcelations must be done a week prior to the date in order to get the full deposit back.</dd>

    <dt>What is henna?</dt>
    <dd>Henna is a tempory stain which is used to create intricate patterns.</dd>

    <dt>How do I take care of my new henna tattoo?</dt>
    <dd>Depending on skin type , placement, and other factors, henna can last anywehre from a week to 3 weeks. The longer the paste is left on the skin the darker the stain thus the longer it will last. Customers typically leave paste on over night for best results but for at least of minimum of 4 hours. Be careful as the process of removal can be messy.Be sure to not to wash off the henna but scrap it off. Try to keep your tattoo from getting wet within the first 48 hours.If you have to get it wet be sure to cover our tattoo with oils such as coconut oil to help protect the henna. The tattoo will appear light at first but remember it will darken over the next 24-48 hours.</dd>
