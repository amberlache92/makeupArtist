   <dt>   Im not having a wedding can I still use your servces for my event?</dt>
    <dd>Of course! I do makeup for any occasion. If you want your makeup done for an event or othr special occaison pelase contact me at least 3 days in advance .However time is of the essence since appointments hare hard to find last minute.</dd>

  <dt>How far In advance should I book for my wedding</dt>
   <dd>Typically people book as far as a year in advance for their wedding. The sooner you schedule the better it is for you. Bridal sappointments should be booked no late than 6 months before your big day.</dd>


  <dt> Is there a travel fee?</dt>
   <dd> I travel up to 25 miles within the 45202 zipcode with no charge. Additional charge varies depending on the distance.I do all appointments on location. </dd>

   <dt> Can You also do hair for ym wedding?</dt>
    <dd>Unfortunately that is not in my list of strong skills. However I am able to direct you to hairstylists that you can enlist for your special day. Hair should done before the makeup application process because you do not want to mess up your makeup when you change.</dd>

   <dt> How do I prepare for my makeup application?</dt>
    <dd>Make sure that you exfoilate and wash your face up  2 hours before  and make sure you have a good skin care routine the weeks prior to the appointment date. No products should be added prior to the makep application  for the best possible results. Wearing clothes that either button or zip up would be most apporptiate to not mess up the makeup.</dd>


    <dt>How do I book an appointment?</dt>
      <dd>To book an appointment you can call or email me.I typically respond within 48 hours to discuss what your looking for. All appointments require a deposit.</dd>

   <dt>QIf Something comes up can I reschedule or cancel my appointent</dt>
    <dd>If you must reshedule  I suggest doing so in a timely manner in order to get the date that you want.I would also sugguest being very sure of the date the first time around. Cancellcetations must be done a week prior to the date in order to get the full deposit back.</dd>
